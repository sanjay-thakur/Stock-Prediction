## Project Overview

The Stock Market Prediction project focuses on:

- Collecting and preparing historical stock price data.
- Engineering relevant features to enhance model performance.
- Training machine learning models for time series forecasting.
- Evaluating and visualizing model predictions.
- Gaining insights into potential future stock price movements.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Obtain historical stock price data from a reliable source. Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

2. **Feature Engineering**: Identify and engineer relevant features that might impact stock prices, such as technical indicators, moving averages, and lagged variables.

3. **Data Splitting**: Split the data into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring that the time periods are appropriately partitioned.

4. **Model Selection and Training**: Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for time series forecasting, such as ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet. Train and fine-tune the selected model.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. Compare the predicted vs. actual stock price trends using visualizations.

6. **Forecasting**: Utilize the trained model to make future stock price predictions. Plot forecasts and confidence intervals for future time periods.

7. **Interpretation and Insights**: Interpret the model's predictions, providing insights into potential price movements. Discuss the limitations and factors impacting model accuracy.
